# Remote-mouse

Remote-mouse is a tiny **experimental** webapp(built with node.js and plain js), which enables you to locally run a tiny webapp server to remote control your mouse. This may change or may break, and that is entirely on you.

## How to run
Install Node.js
Install NPM dependencies(npm install)
node server.js

Now the webapp will be available on your local IP running on port 8081, no further setup needed
